## üîÅ Workflow Guide

### 1. Create a Project Scope

Define a new environment scope to manage the root of your solution:

```bash
apex -folder <project_root_path> <project_name>
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This will **overwrite existing configuration** without confirmation.

---

### 2. List Existing Scopes

You can view existing scopes with:
```bash
apex environ -list
# Or for a specific project:
apex environ -list <project_name>
# or to view the current project
apex config
```

---
### 3. Switch Active Scope

Change the current project:
```bash
apex environ <new project name>
```

---

### 4. Configure Project Parameters

Modify specific scope settings using:

```bash
apex config <property> <value>
```

Available configuration keys:

- `mount`: Folder mappings to be mounted into containers
- `container`: Path where Dockerfiles are generated
- `network`: Docker network name
- `env`: Source file for environment variables (default is `.env` in project root)

---

### 5. Prepare Configuration Files

Generate APEX configuration files:

```bash
apex prepare  [-pwd <password>]
```

This creates:

- Settings JSON files
- Angular environment UI config
- Migration settings

If a password is provided, a PFX SSL certificate will also be generated for HTTPS use.

#### Example Docker build

The following is auto-configured if you use `apex docker` to generate Docker:

```json
{
  "CSharp": {
    "Volume": {
      "./mount/settings": "/app/deployment",
      "./mount/Logs": "/app/Logs"
    }
  },
  "Client": {
    "Volume": {
      "./mount/webapp/scripts": "/usr/share/nginx/html/assets/env",
      "./mount/webapp/ssl": "/etc/nginx/ssl"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 6. Generate Docker Files

Generate Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.yml` for your services:

```bash
apex docker -- [-sys] [-util] [-image (image location)]
```

- Automatically detects and generates Dockerfiles and docker compose files for C# web apps.
- Prepares the `docker-compose` configuration with mounts and environment settings.

You can then start your application with:

```bash
docker compose -f <Mount folder> up -d
```

## üìù Implementation Notes

- Container builds now support:
  1. Optional `appsettings` from `app/development`
  2. Angular UI Docker env integration using generated settings
  3. Database migration settings
  4. OIDC app now supports insert **and** update
  5. Protocol forwarding support for auth services
  6. JWT certificate issuer validation
